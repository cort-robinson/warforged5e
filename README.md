## :dart: About ##

Warforged5e is a tool made for dungeon masters, by dungeon masters. Starting is as easy as pulling it up, with no complicated organization trees or button combos. If you want to speed up the logistics of your table so your players can get to slaying the monsters, wooing the damsels, and saving the kingdom (or murderhoboing, whichever is their fancy) then Warfoged5e is what youâ€™re looking for.

Wizards of the Coast provide wonderful support for their games with manuals, guides, and supplementary materials seemingly falling from the skyâ€¦ for a price. Even if the dungeon master acquires all of this material it can be difficult to pull it all together to build a coherent encounter. With Warforged5e, this presents no issue, as all official monsters are present in a simple, alphabetical list, ready to be brought forth to end the career of your prospective heroes. Once the battle is started, the basic stats for these monsters are at your fingertips, so no need to flip through the source books or look them up on the wiki.

"Roll for initiative!" - A classic turn of phrase for the dungeon master to announce combat, but instead of heralding a bout of heart pumping action, generally it announces a break as the dungeon master rolls initiative for all of his monsters and creates a turn order so his player can slot in. With Warforged5e, this ten minute or so chore becomes as simple as a few easy clicks!
